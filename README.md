# Twitch EventSub Unity Integration

This project provides a simple integration of Twitch's EventSub API for Unity projects. It allows developers to easily incorporate Twitch events into their Unity games or applications.

## Dependencies

- System.Net is required. (No WebGL support)
- NativeWebSocket
	- Needed for WebSocket functionality.
	- A native Unity Package.
	- Use Unity's package manager to acquire the package.
	- https://github.com/endel/NativeWebSocket.git
- Newtonsoft Json
	- Added for advanced json serialization and deserialization functionality.
	- A native Unity package.
	- Use Unity's package manager to acquire the package.

## Features

- Easy setup with minimal configuration
- Supports Twitch events: Raids, Chat Messages, Subscriptions, Gifted Subs, and Follows
- Handles OAuth authentication flow
- Persistent credential storage
- Support for connecting to Twitch CLI mock server for testing

## Setup

1. Register to Twitch Developers and register your app.
	- If you want to use Twitch CLI for testing. Make sure to choose "Client Type" as "Confidential" and generate your "Client Secret" for local mock server setup.
	- Note that "Client Secret" is no longer needed for websocket API connection but needed for Twitch CLI to function.
2. Add the `TwitchManager` script to a GameObject in your Unity scene.
3. Set your Twitch application's Client ID in the `TwitchManager` component in the Inspector.

## Usage

The `EventSubHandler` class handles incoming Twitch events. Modify this class to implement your desired functionality for each event type.

Example:

```csharp
public class EventSubHandler : MonoBehaviour, IEventHandler
{
    public void OnChatMessage(Event chatEvent)
    {
	// Implement other functionality here
        Debug.Log($"Chat message from {chatEvent.chatter_user_name}: {chatEvent.message.text}");
    }

}
```

## Mock Server Testing

To test your integration without connecting to the live Twitch API, you can use the Twitch CLI mock server:

1. Set up and run the Twitch CLI mock server.
2. In the Unity Inspector, find the `TwitchManager` component and enable the "Use Mock Server" toggle.

This will direct all API calls to the local mock server instead of the live Twitch API, allowing for easier testing and development.

To setup the server:
1. You need to first install Twitch CLI.
	- https://github.com/twitchdev/twitch-cli
2. Configure your Twitch CLI by setting your Client ID and Client Secret.
	- Initiate the setup process by using "twitch configure" command.
3. Start your server with WebSocket functionality.

```bash
twitch event websocket start-server
```

4. You can use event triggers to test your code.

Example:

```bash
twitch event trigger channel.subscribe --transport=websocket
```

## Customization

Feel free to modify and extend the functionality to suit your project's needs. You can add support for additional Twitch events by updating the `EventSubClient` and `EventSubHandler` classes.

## Limitations

- Currently supports a limited set of Twitch events (Raids, Chat Messages, Subscriptions, Gifted Subs, and Follows)
- Requires a Twitch Developer application for authentication when not using the mock server
- System.net is required. There is no way to implement this package into a WebGL project.
